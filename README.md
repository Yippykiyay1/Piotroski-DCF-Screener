# Piotroski-DCF-Screener
This project is a financial health screening program that uses DCF valuations and the 9-point Piotroski F-1 score to filter for undervalued and financially healthy companies. The data is extracted from the Y(ahoo)Finance API and is viewed best in Excel.

Note: The uploaded dataset is a previous one as I have been locked out of YFinance (for now) because I used it so much.
